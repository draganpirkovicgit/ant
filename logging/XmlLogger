Writes all build information out to an XML file named log.xml, or the value of the XmlLogger.file property if present, when 
used as a listener. 
When used as a logger, it writes all output to either the console or to the value of -logfile. Whether used as a listener or logger,
the output is not generated until the build is complete, as it buffers the information in order to provide timing information for task,
targets, and the project.

By default the XML file creates a reference to an XSLT file log.xsl in the current directory; 
look in ANT_HOME/etc for one of these.
You can set the property ant.XmlLogger.stylesheet.uri to provide a URI to a style sheet. 
This can be a relative or absolute file path,or an HTTP URL. 
If you set the property to the empty string, , no XSLT transform is declared at all.

ant -listener org.apache.tools.ant.XmlLogger
ant -logger org.apache.tools.ant.XmlLogger -verbose -logfile build_log.xml
